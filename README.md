# morse_code_signal

The app has a simple design and a single directive.

1. Take a `message` from user in plain text english.

2. Convert the `message` into morse code.

3. Blink the flashlight/torch of the mobile device to signal the morse code generated in **step 2**.


The app currently only supports the English Alphabets and Indo-Arabic numbers.
